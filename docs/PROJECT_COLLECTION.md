5. Add the following additional fields with the specified (type):
- Long Description (Text)
- Primary Language (Text)
- Technology Used (Tags)
- Screenshot (Image)
- Link to Project (URL)
- Release Date (Date and Time)

6. Add a few items to your new collection and make sure they have at least 1 Technology Used tag that does not overlap. This will be helpful for testing filtering later on.
