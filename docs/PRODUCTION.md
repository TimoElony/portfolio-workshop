## Go Live!

We finished building or application. Now, we want to publish or website. There are a few things we need to know before:

- [Sandbox vs. Live](https://support.wix.com/en/article/accessing-your-sandbox-and-live-database-collections) - Each of your collections has two versions; one copy is your site's sandbox data, and the other is your site's live data. The sandbox data is what you work with while creating your site. The live data is what your visitors interact with once your site is published.
- [Collection Permissions](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-collection-permissions) - Give you control over which visitors are allowed to interact with the data in your collections and what they are allowed to do.
- [Publish your Site](https://support.wix.com/en/article/publishing-your-site-6980885) - Publish your site every time you make changes so that they appear on your live site.
- [Monitor your application](https://support.wix.com/en/article/corvid-about-site-monitoring) - Lets you gather information about Wix site events, such as console logs, HTTP functions, and web module functions.

**:white_check_mark: Step-by-Step Instructions**
1. **PUBLISH** your site.
2. Don't forget to give it a descriptive name instead of the standard _mysite_.
3. You can also update your QR Code Generation function to be your new site URL. In your _qrCode.jsw_ file, **update the `qrCodeLink` variable to be your site URL**.
4. **Publish** your site again for these changes to take on the live site.
